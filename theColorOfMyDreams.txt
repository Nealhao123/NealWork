The Colour of My Dreams - Andy Burrows 

I'm a really rotten reader 
I'm the worst in all the class 
The sort of rotten reader that makes you want to laugh 
I'm last in all the reading tests 
My scores not on the page 
When I read to teacher she gets in such a rage 
She says I cannot form my words 
She says I can't build up 
And that I don't know phonics 
And don't know cat from cut 
They say than I'm dyslexic 
That's a word they just found out 
But when I get some plastacine 
I know what that's about 
I make these scary monsters 
I draw these secret lands 
I get my hair all sticky 
And paint all on my hands 
I make these super models 
I build these smashing towers 
They reach up to the ceiling 
And take me hours and hours 
She says I cannot form my words 
She says I can't build up 
And that I don't know phonics 
And don't know cat from cut 
They say than I'm dyslexic 
That's a word they just found out 
But when I get some plastacine 
I know what that's about 
I paint these lovely pictures 
In thick green drippy paint 
It gets on all the carpert 
And makes the cleaners faint 
I build great magic forests 
Wee bushed out of string 
And paint pink pandarellos 
And birds that really sing 
She says I cannot form my words 
She says I can't build up 
And that I don't know phonics 
And don't know cat from cut 
They say than I'm dyslexic 
That's a word they just found out 
But when I get some plastacine 
I know what that's about 
I play my world of real believe 
I play it every day 
People stand and watch me 
But don't know what to say 
They give me diagnostic tests 
And try out reading schemes 
But none of them will ever know 
The colour of my dreams
