How many roads must a man walk down
before they call him a man
How many seas must a white dove sail
before she sleeps in the sand
How many times must the cannon balls fly
before they're forever banned
the answer my freind is blowing in the wind
....
How many years must a mountain exist
Before it is washed to the sea 
How many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free
How many times can a man turn his head
And pretend that he just doesn't see 
the answer my friend is blowing in the wind
the answer is blowing in the wind.

How many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky
How many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry
How many deaths will it take
till he knows that too many people have died
the answer my friend,is blowing in the wind 
the answer is blowing in the wind.
